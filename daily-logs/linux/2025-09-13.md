# Day 3 - Practicing Linux Commands Independently (13th Sept 2025)

## ðŸ“š What I Did
- Practiced all Linux commands I learned in the previous day **without watching videos**.  
- Used only the **notes I wrote** during the course as reference.  
- Focused on commands for:  
  - File management (`ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`)  
  - File editing (`nano`, `vi`, `echo`)  
  - Searching (`grep`, `find`, `sed`)  
  - User management (`useradd`, login, permissions, `chmod`, `chown`)

## âš¡ Challenges Faced
- Some commands didnâ€™t work exactly as expected at first (typos or wrong paths).  
- Solved issues **independently** using online documentation and forums.  
- Learned to **troubleshoot errors** on my own instead of relying on video instructions.

## ðŸŽ‰ Achievement
- Successfully executed **all previous commands independently**.  
- Developed confidence in **Linux command-line usage** and problem-solving skills.  
- Realized the importance of **practicing without guidance** to strengthen memory and skills.
