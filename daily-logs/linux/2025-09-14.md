# Day 4 - Linux for DevOps: System Info, Packages, Networking & Processes (14th Sept 2025)

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
Watched videos and practiced side-by-side to extend my Linux knowledge.

### System Information
- `free` â†’ check memory usage  
- `cat /proc/cpuinfo` â†’ CPU details  
- `uname -a` â†’ system and kernel version  

### Package Management (YUM)
- Install packages: `yum install <package>`  
- Remove packages: `yum remove <package>`  
- Update packages: `yum update`  
- Get package info: `yum list`, `yum info`  

### Networking
- `hostname` â†’ get system hostname  
- `ping` â†’ test connectivity  
- `wget` â†’ download files from the web  
- `ifconfig` â†’ check IP & network info  
- `curl` â†’ interact with web endpoints  

### Telnet
- Understood basics of **telnet** for testing ports and connectivity.  

### Services
- Check/manage services with:  
  - `service <name> status|start|stop`  
  - `chkconfig` (older systems)  
  - `systemctl <action> <service>` (modern systems)  

### Process Management
- `ps` â†’ view running processes  
- `top` â†’ monitor system resource usage  
- `fg`, `bg` â†’ bring jobs to foreground/background  

---

## âš¡ Challenges Faced
- Sometimes commands like `ifconfig` were not available (needed `net-tools` package).  
- Had to remember differences between `service` and `systemctl`.  
- Learned that process management requires focus to avoid killing the wrong task.  

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Achievement
- Now I can **gather system info, install/update packages, check networking, manage services, and monitor processes**.  
- This knowledge is essential for real-world DevOps work on Linux servers.  

---

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
- Practice on my Linux server.  
- Explore **logs and monitoring** (`journalctl`, log files in `/var/log/`).  
- Learn about **process priorities** (`nice`, `renice`, `kill`).
